My NLP and TTS works explored related but complementary directions.
My focus was largely on editing of machine translation (MT) outputs to improve their quality. This included both interactive and automatic post-editing scenarios. The former includes user interactions to help tailor the outputs for better quality while the latter targets fixing specific errors patterns of the base MT model.

* Interactive post-editing for verbosity controlled translation with Prabhakar Gupta, Anil Nelakanti, Grant M. Berry, Abhishek Sharma, in COLING Conference, 2022. Available at ACL.
* Adapting Neural Machine Translation for Automatic Post-Editing with Abhishek Sharma, Prabhakar Gupta, in Conference on Machine Translation (WMT) 2021. Available at ACL.

Our text-to-speech (TTS) work focussed on improving emotiveness of speech outputs to make them closed to humans for conversational HCI systems. Another direction was to improve the data-efficiency of TTS by leveraging independently trained acoustic models. This significantly improves language adoption by reducing the threshold paired data needed to as few as five hours.

* Empathic machines: using intermediate features as levers to emulate emotions in text-to-speech system with Saiteja Kosgi, Sarath Sivaprasad, Niranjan Pedanekar, Vineet Gandhi in NAACL Conference 2022. On ACL.
