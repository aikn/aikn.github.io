Update: I will be joining the faculty at IIIT Hyderabad in July 2025. Please consider applying for open positions detailed [here](talks/openings).

My interests lie in machine learning and its applications to various perceptory and behavioral data including vision, language, speech, robotics and search. 
I am with Amazon while in the past I worked with a startup (Cube26 later acquired by PayTM) and taught at a university (IIT-BHU, Varansi). Before that I worked with SIERRA/INRIA in Paris and with MLS/XRCE in Grenoble towards a doctoral degree defending it in February of 2014 graduating from the University of Paris. I was advised by [Cedric](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/c.archambeau/), [Francis](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/) and [Guillaume](https://gbouchar.github.io/) and even earlier worked with [Edmond](http://morpheo.inrialpes.fr/people/Boyer/) for my masters.
